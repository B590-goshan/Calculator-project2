# Calculator

\# Project 2

This is a basic calculator application designed for Android using Kotlin and XML.
It emulates the functionality of a typical smartphone calculator, enabling users to effortlessly perform fundamental arithmetic calculations.

## **Features**  

The following **core functionalities** have been implemented:  

* A fully functional calculator layout with buttons for digits, arithmetic operations, and special functions.  
* Users can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
* Users can reset the calculator using the `C` button.  
* Users can toggle the sign of a number with the `+/-` button.  
* Users can compute percentages using the `%` button.  
* Users see real-time updates of their input in the top `TextView`.  
* Decimal numbers are supported via the `.` button.  
* Users can enter continuous calculations without needing to press `=` after each operation.
* Users can perform sin, cos, tan, log10, and ln scientific calculations.

### **Additional Enhancements:**  

* Full Persistence IO on Screen Rotation : Users will have retained input and results when the screen rotates on every orientations.
* Every button press is logged in LogCat for debugging and tracking.
* Preventing Multiple Decimal Points
* Enhanced UI and proper error-handling with Scientific Buttons in Landscape Mode

## **Demo Walkthrough**  

Below is a walkthrough demonstrating the app’s functionality:

## Notes

1. Ensuring consistent number formatting - Used String.format("%.6f", result) instead of toString().
2. Handling invalid scientific calculations - Prevented operations like log10(0), ln(-5), and division by zero.
3. Preventing multiple decimals - Blocked multiple . entries in the same number.
4. Losing input on screen rotation - Used onSaveInstanceState() to store and restore input.
